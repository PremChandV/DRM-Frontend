        <h1 style="text-align: center;">About Us</h1>
        <p>RCI embarked on the ambitious air defence programme in the year 2000. It was recognized that the programme requires a
            large size of real time, machine critical and highly reliable software to developed by various work centers in a
            short span of time.</p>
        
        <p>To strengthen the quality software development effort in RCI. Software Quality Assurance Division was formed in june
            2002.</p>
        
        <p>The responsibility of DSQA is to ensure that all software products developed in RCI are as per international
            standards following well-define certified software processes. This will help develop high reliable software and
            induce professionalism into the art of software development at RCI.</p>
        
        <p>Quality defines to any measurable characteristics such as correctness, maintainability, portability, testability,
            usability, reliability, efficiency, integrity, reusability and interoperability.</p>
        
        <p>Software Quality: Software Quality is deefined as the conformance to explicity state functional and performance
            requirements , explicity documented development standards , and inherient characteristics that are expected of all
            professionally developed software. </p>
        
        <p>Quality Control : Quality control involes a series of inspections , reviews and test used throughout the software
            process to ensure each work product meets the requirements place upon it.</p>
        
        <p>Quality control includes a feedback loop to the process that created the work product.</p>
        
        <p>Quality Of Conformance : Is the degree to which the design specifications are followed during manufacturing,greater
            the degree of conformance, the higher is the level of quality of conformance.</p>
        
        <p>Vision Empowering the nation with state-of-the-art indigenous Defence technologies and systems.</p>
        
        <p>Mission Design, develop and lead to production state-of-the-art sensors, weapon systems, platforms and allied
            equipment for our Defence Services. Provide technological solutions to the Services to optimise combat effectiveness
            and to promote well-being of the troops. Develop infrastructure and committed quality manpower and build strong
            indigenous technology base.</p>
        
        <p>RCI, a premier R&D organization in the country with an objective of developing frontier technologies for Defence
            applications.</p>
        
        <p>RCI has considered as ‘Avionics Hub’ of DRDO. It is one of the three DRDO Labs of ‘Missile Complex‘. It houses
            different work centers, integration and testing facilities.RCI is a leading laboratory of Defence Research
            Development Organization (DRDO) and responsible for development of missile system and also design, development and
            participation in production of missile avionics like Inertial Navigation Systems, Control Systems, Real Time
            Embedded Computers, Imaging Infrared Seeker, Radio Frequency Seeker and Power Supply Systems. Telemetry and
            Telecommand systems are also developed in RCI to evaluate missile performance during its development phase. RCI is
            an ISO 9001-2000 laboratory. RCI focus is to design and develop world class, State-of-the-art missile technologies
            which will produce precise and reliable indigenous weapon systems to strengthen country’s Armed Forces. Quality Of
            Design: Quality of design refers to the characteristics that designers specifies for an item, the grade of materials
            ,tolerances,and performance specifications that all contribute to the quality of design.</p>
        
        <p>The Infrastructure facilities established include state-of-the–art Electro Magnetic interference / Electromagnetic
            Compatibility, Environmental test facility for climatic and dynamic testing of Missile Avionic Systems and Compact
            Antenna test facility. The first indigenous Trishul missile was successfully flight tested with indigenous Control
            and Navigation Systems. Subsequently Prithvi and other missiles were successfully flight tested with indigenous
            avionic systems after thorough testing in simulation laboratory and extensive Environmental testing. Subsequently
            several core technology areas were identified and added to RCI.
